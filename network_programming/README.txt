Part 1:

Copied over the index.html file and images directory over.

Working
------
Most of part 2 works correctly with Jae's web root. Trying to run for /tng/index.html with my web root is unresponsive, working on figuring out why that is happening despite having copied over the files from Jae's directory and given all the required permissions. Part 1 works perfectly okat though.

Trying to figure out why stuff from mdb-lookup isn't being sent and how to send stuff from the ndb-lookup backend for the http-server. 

For the ones I have implemented successfully, I hava no valgrind leaks and errors.
